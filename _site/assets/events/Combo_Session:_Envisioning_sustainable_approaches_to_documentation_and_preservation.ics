DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/0r9m32nh9c\n\n Keep
 ing documentation isolated to individuals - in email inboxes or other sing
 le location - is unsustainable. We’ve aggregated documentation for 200+ 
 digital collections into a central\, shared repository. We’ll share how 
 we did this\, what we’re documenting\, who has access\, and why it was i
 mportant to collaborate with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nDigita
 l Humanities (DH) projects are complex with multiple moving components in 
 need of preservation. Early preservation planning for each component is a 
 strategy for long-term access. This presentation will break down various c
 omponents of a DH project\, preservation approaches for those components\,
  packaging methods for future recreation/emulation.\n\nDigital artifacts p
 ose new challenges for delayed-release archiving. To protect our historica
 l record for future generations\, we propose Strong Dark Archives (SDA)\, 
 a blended administrative and technical protocol for securing delayed-relea
 sed archival materials among networks of libraries.
