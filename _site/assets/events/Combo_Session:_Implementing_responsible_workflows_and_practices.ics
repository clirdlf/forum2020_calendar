DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/833mw28s69\n\n This
  presentation will focus on definitions and ethical applications for use/r
 euse of digital materials. The speakers will: provide finalized definition
 s for use/reuse\; introduce the impact assessment matrix and ethical guide
 lines\; and address the lack of common practices for what constitutes and 
 how to assess reuse of digital materials.\n\nUC Berkeley Libraryâ€™s respo
 nsible access workflows and a corresponding community engagement policy su
 pport cultural heritage institutions seeking to digitize special collectio
 ns by helping institutions navigate complex areas of law and policy. They 
 also address social justice\, adopting an ethics of care approach that bal
 ances potential value and harm.\n\nWe discuss how we've trained and suppor
 ted dozens of library workers researching copyright information on thousan
 ds of 20th century serials held by Penn\, and publishing it as linked open
  data via Wikidata. We show how the data benefits digitization projects an
 d researchers\, and how more can get involved.
