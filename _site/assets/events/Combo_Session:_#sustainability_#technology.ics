DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/cn6xw48940\n\n This
  presentation will describe the value of making organizational infrastruct
 ure (and specifically documentation) a central focus of your digital prese
 rvation program. Emphasis will be put on how documentation can help move y
 our institution’s digital preservation project(s) to a programmatic ente
 rprise on the level of other key library functions.\n\nHarvard Library’s
  new preservation storage infrastructure relies on tiered storage and auto
 mated disposition of content based upon its formal characteristics and ass
 essed curatorial value. The system is designed to embrace the widest range
  of storage technologies and providers\, and offer enhanced operational fl
 exibility and cost-minimization without sacrificing imperative stewardship
  goals.\n\nThe Texas Digital Library (TDL) and the University of Californi
 a\, San Diego Library (UCSD)\, are exploring the establishment of a distri
 buted digital preservation service for sensitive data. The project\, funde
 d by IMLS\, will develop a model for a DDP service that would close gaps i
 n preservation offerings for such data.
