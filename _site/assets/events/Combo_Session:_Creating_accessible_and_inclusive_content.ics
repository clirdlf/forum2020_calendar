DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/ht2g737p1n\n\n Rece
 nt lawsuits against Hunters Point Library in New York for violation of Ame
 ricans with Disabilities Act (ADA) evidence that accessibility is not opti
 onal\, but rather mandatory for professional at all levels. This presentat
 ion builds on different fields to present approaches to address accessibil
 ity for practitioners in digital library\, archives\, and museums.\n\nDigi
 tal libraries are expected to follow accessibility guidelines to ensure pe
 ople with disabilities can use them. Our presentation addresses the fourth
  requirement of the internationally adopted Web Content Accessibility Guid
 elines\, which requires web content to work with peopleâ€™s assistive tech
 nologies. This requirement is often neglected\, perhaps because of its com
 plexity.\n\nAs video content increases in importance online and in digital
  collections\, it is vital that this content be accessible. While captions
  are the best known accessibility feature for videos\, audio description a
 nd transcripts are important to include all users. This presentation will 
 introduce these features and workflows for their creation.
