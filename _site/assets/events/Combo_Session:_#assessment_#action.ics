DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/dv1cj8830x\n\n In F
 all 2019\, NARA released a draft of its Digital Preservation Framework for
  public comment. We’ll discuss the past year’s work and what’s next 
 as our holdings continue to grow. We hope by sharing about the framework a
 nd soliciting feedback\, it will serve as a digital preservation community
  resource.\n\nDiAGRAM is a decision support system\, developed by The Nati
 onal Archives\, the Applied Statistics & Risk Unit\, and partner archives.
  It is based on a probabilistic graphical model that captures the complex 
 interdependencies of risk events and allows archivists to quantitatively e
 valuate their impact and compare potential risk management strategies.\n\n
 How are Canadians making active plays towards digital preservation? We wil
 l present the results of the CARL Digital Preservation Working Group surve
 y of Canadian memory institutions\, and the subsequent development of thre
 e focus areas to address key gaps in their ability to safely pass digital 
 collections into the future.
