    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    Representatives from the IMLS-funded Collective Responsibility: National Forum on Labor Practices for Grant-Funded Digital Positions steering committee will introduce and demonstrate the use of three tools to promote labor equity. Attendees will learn more about equitable project design, grant application language, and talking about contingency at work.<br /><br />Learn about appropriately using color in charts, some online tools for selecting and evaluating colorblind-safe color palettes, and four design principles for creating maximally accessible data visualizations for all readers (simplicity, context, legibility, and contrast).<br /><br />While a custom-built digital collection, exhibition, or repository can be a huge undertaking, it doesn’t need to be! This session showcases Jekyll and Wax as helpful tools for building digital scholarship projects minimally. We’ll explain the philosophy behind these tools, explore an example repository, and direct you to additional resources.<br /><br />Oral History as Data (OHD) is a static web tool that transforms interview transcript data into interactive websites. Users can publish, search, visualize, and share the text and audio/video from oral histories, qualitative interviews and similar outputs via the web in a few simple steps.

    This presentation will focus on definitions and ethical applications for use/reuse of digital materials. The speakers will: provide finalized definitions for use/reuse; introduce the impact assessment matrix and ethical guidelines; and address the lack of common practices for what constitutes and how to assess reuse of digital materials.<br /><br />UC Berkeley Library’s responsible access workflows and a corresponding community engagement policy support cultural heritage institutions seeking to digitize special collections by helping institutions navigate complex areas of law and policy. They also address social justice, adopting an ethics of care approach that balances potential value and harm.<br /><br />We discuss how we've trained and supported dozens of library workers researching copyright information on thousands of 20th century serials held by Penn, and publishing it as linked open data via Wikidata. We show how the data benefits digitization projects and researchers, and how more can get involved.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    Recent lawsuits against Hunters Point Library in New York for violation of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) evidence that accessibility is not optional, but rather mandatory for professional at all levels. This presentation builds on different fields to present approaches to address accessibility for practitioners in digital library, archives, and museums.<br /><br />Digital libraries are expected to follow accessibility guidelines to ensure people with disabilities can use them. Our presentation addresses the fourth requirement of the internationally adopted Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which requires web content to work with people’s assistive technologies. This requirement is often neglected, perhaps because of its complexity.<br /><br />As video content increases in importance online and in digital collections, it is vital that this content be accessible. While captions are the best known accessibility feature for videos, audio description and transcripts are important to include all users. This presentation will introduce these features and workflows for their creation.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    This presentation discusses the Penn and Slavery Project, an augmented reality tour and a research website, in the context of political and technological realities at the University of Pennsylvania. It considers how librarians structured opportunities to empower students to harness the possibility and technology of augmented reality for public scholarship.<br /><br />We can’t meet safely in person, but we can still gather to share best practices and build community. Join representatives from the IIIF Consortium, the LD4 Conference planning committee, and CLIR/DLF as they discuss the opportunities and the pitfalls prompted by the pandemic-related cancellation of in-person events.<br /><br />This presentation will describe the collaborative development process of CollectionBuilder, a static web application that uses Jekyll, APIs, and structured metadata to improve the browsing, design, and visualization capacities for digital collections. Community-driven collaboration with partner institutions has broadened the capacity of CollectionBuilder as a skin interface and teaching tool.<br /><br />Providing access to sensitive data is unpopular within digital libraries and repositories due to the inherent disclosure risk. Hashicorp's Vault platform has made it possible for us to implement a lightweight solution for secure, zero-knowledge encryption of deposited datasets, while still facilitating access requests.<br /><br />In the summer of 2020, librarians and undergraduates at Gettysburg College collaborated virtually to develop the DH Toolkit, a collection of digital learning objects for Digital Humanities tools and concepts. This lightning talk will discuss the collaborative framework for creating the toolkit and its future in DH pedagogy at Gettysburg.<br /><br />Despite demand, academic libraries struggle to provide big bibliometric datasets for their patrons due to the cost and specialized expertise the datasets require. CADRE is a cloud-based platform for sharing, provisioning, and analyzing big bibliometric data. Libraries share CADRE development expenses to reduce per-library costs, while increasing access for patrons.<br /><br />This presentation will focus on the complexities, challenges, and collaboration that was necessary for completion of a three-year NEH grant to digitize, describe, and publicly release the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Collection. Challenges include redacting social security numbers, establishing authority records, describing esoteric text, and developing a content management system.<br /><br />The presenters conducted a multi-stage, multi-year research study of the images required to represent complex scrapbooks in an online environment. This presentation reflects on the process of the study, the methods used, what went well, and what they would do differently. Findings from the research will also be presented.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    As academic librarians increasingly teach data science skills, attention must be paid to scholarship arguing that big data increases inequality. By integrating data justice principles into instruction, librarians can encourage students to become responsible data practitioners. This presentation outlines ways librarians can include ethics and justice in data instruction.<br /><br />This presentation offers student and instructor perspectives on archival justice in the DH graduate classroom and the various DH literacies and competencies such a focus enables. In particular, we provide a closer look at the creation of "Digital El Diario," a project that resulted from a discipline-agnostic graduate course.<br /><br />This presentation examines the community activism and archival work in Minneapolis, Minnesota related to anti-police violence against BIPOC. It highlights the work of activist Wanja Kuria, who, after Floyd’s murder, began protesting racism, state-sanctioned violence and documenting the ways in which the Black Lives Matter Movement operates on the ground.

    This talk shares experiences in identifying ways to disrupt metadata bias. The goal of these efforts is to arrive at a process that identifies and incorporates controlled vocabularies from marginalized communities, that respects their interests, and is not hindered by metadata formats or system technology.<br /><br />Too often when documenting movement, the community within which dances are created is ignored or overlooked. By combining insights from knowledgeable members of the communities themselves with new technological tools we can improve the interdisciplinary study of dance and other forms of movement through structured data and well-curated digital resources. <br /><br />This presentation describes the metadata schema, content standard, and taxonomy guidelines created for Curationist.org, a crowd-sourced, multilingual aggregator of open access cultural content. Designed to accommodate multiple layers of metadata and to reflect Curationist’s progressive values, eventually, this collectively enhanced dataset will be available as linked open data.

  <div class="abstract">
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    Keeping documentation isolated to individuals - in email inboxes or other single location - is unsustainable. We’ve aggregated documentation for 200+ digital collections into a central, shared repository. We’ll share how we did this, what we’re documenting, who has access, and why it was important to collaborate with internal and external stakeholders.<br /><br />Digital Humanities (DH) projects are complex with multiple moving components in need of preservation. Early preservation planning for each component is a strategy for long-term access. This presentation will break down various components of a DH project, preservation approaches for those components, packaging methods for future recreation/emulation.<br /><br />Digital artifacts pose new challenges for delayed-release archiving. To protect our historical record for future generations, we propose Strong Dark Archives (SDA), a blended administrative and technical protocol for securing delayed-released archival materials among networks of libraries.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    In Fall 2019, NARA released a draft of its Digital Preservation Framework for public comment. We’ll discuss the past year’s work and what’s next as our holdings continue to grow. We hope by sharing about the framework and soliciting feedback, it will serve as a digital preservation community resource.<br /><br />DiAGRAM is a decision support system, developed by The National Archives, the Applied Statistics &amp; Risk Unit, and partner archives. It is based on a probabilistic graphical model that captures the complex interdependencies of risk events and allows archivists to quantitatively evaluate their impact and compare potential risk management strategies.<br /><br />How are Canadians making active plays towards digital preservation? We will present the results of the CARL Digital Preservation Working Group survey of Canadian memory institutions, and the subsequent development of three focus areas to address key gaps in their ability to safely pass digital collections into the future.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    This presentation will describe the value of making organizational infrastructure (and specifically documentation) a central focus of your digital preservation program. Emphasis will be put on how documentation can help move your institution’s digital preservation project(s) to a programmatic enterprise on the level of other key library functions.<br /><br />Harvard Library’s new preservation storage infrastructure relies on tiered storage and automated disposition of content based upon its formal characteristics and assessed curatorial value. The system is designed to embrace the widest range of storage technologies and providers, and offer enhanced operational flexibility and cost-minimization without sacrificing imperative stewardship goals.<br /><br />The Texas Digital Library (TDL) and the University of California, San Diego Library (UCSD), are exploring the establishment of a distributed digital preservation service for sensitive data. The project, funded by IMLS, will develop a model for a DDP service that would close gaps in preservation offerings for such data.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    Creating the right team for long-term digital preservation can be hard….really hard. Over several years, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum assembled a “team of rivals” made up of internal staff experts and our preservation software vendor to implement a sustainable, well-support digital repository.<br /><br />This poster presents the results of a survey on 3D and virtual reality preservation methods combined with the results of a multi-case study on 3D datasets at Virginia Tech University Libraries. These results culminated in a proposed 3D/VR preservation workflow employed by VTUL on a current 3D digitization project.<br /><br />Adoption of digital preservation practices and technologies is on the rise, but planning for preservation is not what it used to be, especially for academic libraries. This session will explore the experiences of two archives and libraries in their move to a unified digital preservation system.<br /><br />Fedora 6 will focus on digital preservation by aligning with the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). This presentation will provide an overview of the application design, including a brief introduction to the OCFL, along with a summary of development progress to date and the timeline for the 6.0 release.<br /><br />The Frick Art Reference Library is systematically digitizing 1.2 million photographic images for access and preservation and is using lossless Jpeg-2000 as an archival format to keep their storage needs feasible. This introduces several challenges including new software proficiencies, compatibility issues, and swamping the preservation system.<br /><br />This presentation examines how to scale digital preservation actions for collections comprising millions of objects, including working with stakeholders, automated packaging and ingest processes, and reporting options.<br /><br />Software is ubiquitous worldwide, and ensuring its preservation is important. Adequately preserving and describing complex objects like source code, binaries, and hardware introduces major technical, social, and legal barriers. This panel will explore how staff preserving software create physical and digital workspaces to accomplish their goals.<br /><br />Recovering data from legacy data tapes can be a daunting task. This lightening talk will explore the process of working with taped-based media through the traversal of a series of decisions that takes us from a box of mystery tapes to rescued data.
