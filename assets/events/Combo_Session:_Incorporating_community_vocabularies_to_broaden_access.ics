DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/d79571855s\n\n This
  talk shares experiences in identifying ways to disrupt metadata bias. The
  goal of these efforts is to arrive at a process that identifies and incor
 porates controlled vocabularies from marginalized communities\, that respe
 cts their interests\, and is not hindered by metadata formats or system te
 chnology.\n\nToo often when documenting movement\, the community within wh
 ich dances are created is ignored or overlooked. By combining insights fro
 m knowledgeable members of the communities themselves with new technologic
 al tools we can improve the interdisciplinary study of dance and other for
 ms of movement through structured data and well-curated digital resources.
  \n\nThis presentation describes the metadata schema\, content standard\, 
 and taxonomy guidelines created for Curationist.org\, a crowd-sourced\, mu
 ltilingual aggregator of open access cultural content. Designed to accommo
 date multiple layers of metadata and to reflect Curationistâ€™s progressiv
 e values\, eventually\, this collectively enhanced dataset will be availab
 le as linked open data.
