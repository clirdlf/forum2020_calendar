DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/pc2t43jm2q\n\n Repr
 esentatives from the IMLS-funded Collective Responsibility: National Forum
  on Labor Practices for Grant-Funded Digital Positions steering committee 
 will introduce and demonstrate the use of three tools to promote labor equ
 ity. Attendees will learn more about equitable project design\, grant appl
 ication language\, and talking about contingency at work.\n\nLearn about a
 ppropriately using color in charts\, some online tools for selecting and e
 valuating colorblind-safe color palettes\, and four design principles for 
 creating maximally accessible data visualizations for all readers (simplic
 ity\, context\, legibility\, and contrast).\n\nWhile a custom-built digita
 l collection\, exhibition\, or repository can be a huge undertaking\, it d
 oesn’t need to be! This session showcases Jekyll and Wax as helpful tool
 s for building digital scholarship projects minimally. We’ll explain the
  philosophy behind these tools\, explore an example repository\, and direc
 t you to additional resources.\n\nOral History as Data (OHD) is a static w
 eb tool that transforms interview transcript data into interactive website
 s. Users can publish\, search\, visualize\, and share the text and audio/v
 ideo from oral histories\, qualitative interviews and similar outputs via 
 the web in a few simple steps.
