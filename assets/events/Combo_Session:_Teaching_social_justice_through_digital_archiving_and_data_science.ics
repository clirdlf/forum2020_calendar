DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/vt1gh9c10x\n\n As a
 cademic librarians increasingly teach data science skills\, attention must
  be paid to scholarship arguing that big data increases inequality. By int
 egrating data justice principles into instruction\, librarians can encoura
 ge students to become responsible data practitioners. This presentation ou
 tlines ways librarians can include ethics and justice in data instruction.
 \n\nThis presentation offers student and instructor perspectives on archiv
 al justice in the DH graduate classroom and the various DH literacies and 
 competencies such a focus enables. In particular\, we provide a closer loo
 k at the creation of "Digital El Diario\," a project that resulted from a 
 discipline-agnostic graduate course.\n\nThis presentation examines the com
 munity activism and archival work in Minneapolis\, Minnesota related to an
 ti-police violence against BIPOC. It highlights the work of activist Wanja
  Kuria\, who\, after Floydâ€™s murder\, began protesting racism\, state-sa
 nctioned violence and documenting the ways in which the Black Lives Matter
  Movement operates on the ground.
