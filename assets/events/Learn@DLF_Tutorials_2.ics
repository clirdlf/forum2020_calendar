DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/696zw1911r\n\n In 2
 016\, multiple organizations launched a Data Management Training Clearingh
 ouse. In 2018\, DMTC was awarded additional support for enhancement from I
 MLS. This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of the newly enhanced
  DMTC by providing hands-on introduction to the search and curation functi
 ons\, and inviting participants to join the DMTC community.\n\nThis tutori
 al will teach the basics of using the open-source mapping program QGIS to 
 georeference digitized maps along with publishing these maps using the sof
 tware development platform GitHub and the mapping platform Mapbox.\n\nThe 
 tutorial will highlight approaches and resources for transforming digital 
 images into data for search and discovery. The tutorial will begin by intr
 oducing the concept of computer vision. We will then share available resou
 rces\, which include tutorials\, white papers\, and critiques of computer 
 vision for identifying features in image collections.
