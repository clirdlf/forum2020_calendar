DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/v11vd6pp4c\n\n Crea
 ting the right team for long-term digital preservation can be hard….real
 ly hard. Over several years\, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
 assembled a “team of rivals” made up of internal staff experts and our
  preservation software vendor to implement a sustainable\, well-support di
 gital repository.\n\nThis poster presents the results of a survey on 3D an
 d virtual reality preservation methods combined with the results of a mult
 i-case study on 3D datasets at Virginia Tech University Libraries. These r
 esults culminated in a proposed 3D/VR preservation workflow employed by VT
 UL on a current 3D digitization project.\n\nAdoption of digital preservati
 on practices and technologies is on the rise\, but planning for preservati
 on is not what it used to be\, especially for academic libraries. This ses
 sion will explore the experiences of two archives and libraries in their m
 ove to a unified digital preservation system.\n\nFedora 6 will focus on di
 gital preservation by aligning with the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). 
 This presentation will provide an overview of the application design\, inc
 luding a brief introduction to the OCFL\, along with a summary of developm
 ent progress to date and the timeline for the 6.0 release.\n\nThe Frick Ar
 t Reference Library is systematically digitizing 1.2 million photographic 
 images for access and preservation and is using lossless Jpeg-2000 as an a
 rchival format to keep their storage needs feasible. This introduces sever
 al challenges including new software proficiencies\, compatibility issues\
 , and swamping the preservation system.\n\nThis presentation examines how 
 to scale digital preservation actions for collections comprising millions 
 of objects\, including working with stakeholders\, automated packaging and
  ingest processes\, and reporting options.\n\nSoftware is ubiquitous world
 wide\, and ensuring its preservation is important. Adequately preserving a
 nd describing complex objects like source code\, binaries\, and hardware i
 ntroduces major technical\, social\, and legal barriers. This panel will e
 xplore how staff preserving software create physical and digital workspace
 s to accomplish their goals.\n\nRecovering data from legacy data tapes can
  be a daunting task. This lightening talk will explore the process of work
 ing with taped-based media through the traversal of a series of decisions 
 that takes us from a box of mystery tapes to rescued data.
