DESCRIPTION:https://2020clirevents.aviaryplatform.com/r/0z70v89v85\n\n This
  presentation discusses the Penn and Slavery Project\, an augmented realit
 y tour and a research website\, in the context of political and technologi
 cal realities at the University of Pennsylvania. It considers how libraria
 ns structured opportunities to empower students to harness the possibility
  and technology of augmented reality for public scholarship.\n\nWe canâ€™t
  meet safely in person\, but we can still gather to share best practices a
 nd build community. Join representatives from the IIIF Consortium\, the LD
 4 Conference planning committee\, and CLIR/DLF as they discuss the opportu
 nities and the pitfalls prompted by the pandemic-related cancellation of i
 n-person events.\n\nThis presentation will describe the collaborative deve
 lopment process of CollectionBuilder\, a static web application that uses 
 Jekyll\, APIs\, and structured metadata to improve the browsing\, design\,
  and visualization capacities for digital collections. Community-driven co
 llaboration with partner institutions has broadened the capacity of Collec
 tionBuilder as a skin interface and teaching tool.\n\nProviding access to 
 sensitive data is unpopular within digital libraries and repositories due 
 to the inherent disclosure risk. Hashicorp's Vault platform has made it po
 ssible for us to implement a lightweight solution for secure\, zero-knowle
 dge encryption of deposited datasets\, while still facilitating access req
 uests.\n\nIn the summer of 2020\, librarians and undergraduates at Gettysb
 urg College collaborated virtually to develop the DH Toolkit\, a collectio
 n of digital learning objects for Digital Humanities tools and concepts. T
 his lightning talk will discuss the collaborative framework for creating t
 he toolkit and its future in DH pedagogy at Gettysburg.\n\nDespite demand\
 , academic libraries struggle to provide big bibliometric datasets for the
 ir patrons due to the cost and specialized expertise the datasets require.
  CADRE is a cloud-based platform for sharing\, provisioning\, and analyzin
 g big bibliometric data. Libraries share CADRE development expenses to red
 uce per-library costs\, while increasing access for patrons.\n\nThis prese
 ntation will focus on the complexities\, challenges\, and collaboration th
 at was necessary for completion of a three-year NEH grant to digitize\, de
 scribe\, and publicly release the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Collection.
  Challenges include redacting social security numbers\, establishing autho
 rity records\, describing esoteric text\, and developing a content managem
 ent system.\n\nThe presenters conducted a multi-stage\, multi-year researc
 h study of the images required to represent complex scrapbooks in an onlin
 e environment. This presentation reflects on the process of the study\, th
 e methods used\, what went well\, and what they would do differently. Find
 ings from the research will also be presented.
